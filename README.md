I want these to work out of the box so theyre gonna be uploaded including the libraries in the plugin..


Alot of these are unfinished projects, perhaps use them for reference or something


if the last modified dates are nearby for multiple plugins its likely from when i last restored my pc (as i have factory reset it a few times) and gained my files back. so some of these may be even older and havent been touched in longer than the dates suggest..
